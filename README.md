# Eric's Competitive Programming Workspace

This repository contains all the competitive programming problems I've worked on (with the exception of Leetcode problems).

### Currently (4/9/22):
- **USACO:** Silver
- **CodeForces:** Unrated
- **LeetCode:** 1649
 
I often see people write huge lists of macros and `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` in their C++ solutions. Not a big fan of that, but I might change my mind sometime down the road.
