# Eric's Competitive Programming Workspace

This repository contains all the competitive programming problems I've worked on (with the exception of Leetcode problems).

### Languages:
- Python3
- C++

I often see a lot of people do things like include `bits/stdc++`, `namespace std`, or just a whole bunch of macros in their C++ code. I personally do not like it, I think it makes the code look unclean. I am not experienced with the C++ language as much as they are, so my opinion might change in the future. Or not. I'm not sure.
