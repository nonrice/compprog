# Eric's Competitive Programming Workspace

This repository contains all the competitive programming problems I've worked on (with the exception of Leetcode problems).

### Languages:
- Python3: Very comfortable with Python. Familiar and easy to write.
- C++: Learnt C++ to the point where it begins to feel like a second home. Starting to use it much more often.
