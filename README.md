# Eric's Competitive Programming Workspace

This repository contains all the competitive programming problems I've worked on (with the exception of Leetcode problems).

### Languages:
- **Python3**: Very comfortable with Python. Familiar and easy to write.
- **C++**: Learnt C++ to the point where it begins to feel like a second home. Starting to use it much more often.

I often see people write huge lists of macros and `#include <bits/stdc++>` in their C++ solutions. Not a big fan of that, but I might change my mind sometime down the road.
